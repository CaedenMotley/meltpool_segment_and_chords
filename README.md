# Hybrid_Melt_Pool_Segmentation

This Repository corresponds to the paper: "Automated segmentation and chord length distribution of melt pools in complex 3D printed metal artifacts."

The complete codes to train and run the Random Forest Model are included. The CNN model is finetuned from the following large CNN model: https://github.com/ep-infosec/28_nasa_pretrained-microscopy-models. Due to memory constraints, the saved models are not included but can be created by running the python scripts included in the CNN folder.
